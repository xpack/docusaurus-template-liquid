### Publish the website

The website deployment is performed automatically when pushing to the
`{{branchWebsite}}` branch, by a dedicated workflow in
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}/actions/workflows/publish-github-pages.yml).

- open {{packageHomepage}}docs/maintainer/#publish-the-website in a separate window
- stop the local web server
- switch to the `{{branchWebsite}}` branch
- **merge** the `{{branchDevelopment}}` branch into the `{{branchWebsite}}` branch
- **push** the `{{branchWebsite}}` branch to GitHub
  :::info
  At this moment an automated GitHub Action will generate and publish the website.
  :::
- checkout the `{{branchDevelopment}}` branch
- wait for the publish to complete
- refresh the web page
- the new release blog post is
in {{packageHomepage}}blog/
- remember the post URL, since it must be used to update the release page
and the X/Twitter announcement

The `{{branchWebsite}}` branch may be subsequently updated, as long as the
version in `package.json` is not changed.

Check the result at {{packageHomepage}}.
