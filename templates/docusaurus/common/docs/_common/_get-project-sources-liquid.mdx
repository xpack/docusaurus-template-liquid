mkdir -p ~/Work/{{githubProjectOrganization}} && \
git clone \
  --branch {{branchMain}} \
  https://github.com/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}.git \
  ~/Work/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}.git
```

<details>
<summary>For development purposes, clone the `{{branchDevelopment}}` branch.</summary>

```sh
rm -rf ~/Work/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}.git && \
mkdir -p ~/Work/{{githubProjectOrganization}} && \
git clone \
  --branch {{branchDevelopment}} \
  https://github.com/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}.git \
  ~/Work/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}.git
```

```sh
git -C ~/Work/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}.git pull
```

## Add links for development

{%- if isXpack == "true" %}

During development, it is convenient to have a writable instance of the
library to make changes in parallel with the parent project.

To facilitate the use of a writable instance of this library in other
projects, add a link from the user's global xPacks store to this local
development folder:

```sh
xpm link -C ~/Work/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}.git
```

And in the projects referring it:

```sh
xpm link {{packageScopedName}}
```
