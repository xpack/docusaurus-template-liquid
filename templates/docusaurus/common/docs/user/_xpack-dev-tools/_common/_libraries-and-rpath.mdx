## Shared libraries

On all platforms the binary xpm packages are **standalone**,
and require only the standard runtime to be present on the host.

All dependencies that are built as shared libraries are copied locally
to the `libexec` folder (or to the same folder as the executable for Windows).

### `DT_RPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

On GNU/Linux the binaries are adjusted to utilise a relative path:

```console
$ readelf -d library.so | grep rpath
 0x000000000000001d (RPATH)            Library rpath: [$ORIGIN]
```

In the GNU `ld.so` search strategy, the `DT_RPATH` has
the highest priority, higher than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, so if the latter
is set in the environment, it should not interfere with the xPack binaries.

Please note that previous versions, up to mid-2020, utilised `DT_RUNPATH`, which
has a priority lower than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`; setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
in the environment overrode `DT_RUNPATH`, resulting in failures to load
the libraries.

### `@rpath` and `@loader_path`

Similarly, on macOS, the binaries are adjusted with `install_name_tool`
(part of CLT) to utilise a relative path.
