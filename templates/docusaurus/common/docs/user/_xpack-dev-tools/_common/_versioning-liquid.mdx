## Versioning

The version string utilised by the
upstream {props.upstreamName ? props.upstreamName : '{{packageConfig.descriptiveName}}'} project
is a three-number string
such as <code>{{releaseSemver}}</code>;
to this string the xPack distribution adds a fourth number,
but since [SemVer](https://semver.org) allows only three numbers,
all additional ones can
be added only as pre-release strings, separated by a dash,
such as <code>{{releaseSemver}}-<b>{{releaseSubversion}}</b></code>. When
published as an npm package, the version receives
a fifth number,
such as <code>{{releaseSemver}}-{{releaseSubversion}}.<b>{{releaseNpmSubversion}}</b></code>.

Since adherence of third-party packages to SemVer is not guaranteed,
it is recommended to avoid referencing the {{longXpackName}} dependency via
SemVer expressions
such as <code>^{{releaseSemver}}-{{releaseSubversion}}</code> or <code>~{{releaseSemver}}-{{releaseSubversion}}</code>, and
prefer exact matches,
such as <code>{{releaseVersion}}</code>.
