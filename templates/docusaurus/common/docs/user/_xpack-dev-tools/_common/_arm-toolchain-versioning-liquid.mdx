## Versioning

The version string utilised by the
upstream **Arm GNU Toolchain** project is somewhat unusual and unstable over time,
(such as <code>{versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()}.Rel1</code>)
therefore the upstream GCC version is preferred, which
is a three-number string
such as <code>{{releaseSemver}}</code>;
to this string the xPack distribution adds a fourth number that represents
the Arm release with the same GCC release, and a fifth number
that represents the xPack release of the same Arm release;
since [SemVer](https://semver.org) allows only three numbers,
all additional ones can
be added only as pre-release strings, separated by a dash,
such as <code>{{releaseSemver}}-<b>{{releaseSubversion}}</b></code>. When
published as an npm package, the version receives
a sixth number,
such as <code>{{releaseSemver}}-{{releaseSubversion}}.<b>{{releaseNpmSubversion}}</b></code>.

Since adherence of third-party packages to SemVer is not guaranteed,
it is recommended to avoid referencing the xPack GNU AArch64 Embedded GCC dependency via
SemVer expressions
such as <code>^{{releaseSemver}}-{{releaseSubversion}}</code> or <code>~{{releaseSemver}}-{{releaseSubversion}}</code>, and
prefer exact matches,
such as <code>{{releaseVersion}}</code>.
