The project received a significant update by transitioning the build
scripts from the cumbersome monolithic XBB Docker images to the more
flexible and modular **xpm** packages. XBB version
[5.0.0](https://xpack.github.io/blog/2023/02/07/xbb-v5.0.0-released/)
marked a major milestone for the xPack project, as it was the first
self-sustained release. This version enabled the creation of new
binary packages using existing binary packages, eliminating the need for
custom Docker images or other compiled tools.
