In **{props.date || 'DATE'}**,
as part of the project restructuring, the website content was migrated
from the xPack Jekyll sub-site to a local Docusaurus configuration
stored in the `website` folder. To ensure continuity, HTML `<meta>`
redirects were added to the old pages.
Additionally, a GitHub Action was implemented to automatically
publish the site upon any pushes to the `website` Git branch.
