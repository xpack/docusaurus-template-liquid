This project currently serves as a supplementary tool for building
the main xPack Development Tools. Since these tools are exclusively
built on macOS and GNU/Linux, to reduce maintenance efforts,
Windows binaries are not currently provided. However, the project is versatile and can be
utilised in any builds; if necessary, Windows binaries can be added in future
releases.
