## Features

All binaries are:

- **Self-contained** (include all required libraries).
- **File-system relocatable** (can be installed in any location).
- Built on slightly older systems (to ensure compatibility with both
old and new systems).

<details>
<summary>Compatibility with older systems</summary>

Given that most operating systems maintain significant compatibility
with older versions, building an application on an older system ensures
that the same binary can run on newer versions. Conversely, building an
application on a newer system may utilize library features that are
not available in older versions, making backward compatibility less
feasible.

</details>

Similarly to [flatpacks](https://flatpak.org) or [snap](https://snapcraft.io),
but significantly simpler, xpm packages include all dependent shared libraries
within the distributed archives, making the binaries independent of
any similar libraries installed on the system. This ensures they
can run on any system without needing specific libraries to be
installed.

Also the builds are configured so that the binaries do not depend on
being installed in specific folders, and can be installed in any
location, including in user folders.
