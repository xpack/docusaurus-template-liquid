## What are xpm packages? (xPacks) {#xpm-packages}

**xpm packages**, abbreviated as **xPacks**, are versatile,
language-neutral software packages. They have been successfully
utilised in C/C++ projects.

<details>
<summary>What the heck are xpm packages (xPacks)? Please, do not introduce another package format!</summary>

Although the initial appearance may seem complex, utilising
xpm packages is, in fact, straightforward.
The design rationale is to automate frequent
operations that occur during software development, such as the
installation of
dependencies, and to ensure reproducibility.

These packages are managed by **[xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/)**
(the xPack Project Manager),
a programme that complements the **[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/)** CLI
(the popular JavaScript package manager), with new language-neutral features.

The xPacks Framework **does NOT introduce a new package format**; instead,
it uses **the same format as npm packages**, which is a collection of
files/folders and a `package.json` file with the package metadata.

**xpm** can install packages from the
same repositories as **npm**, whether public or private.

The packages (usually regular archives, but also git repositories),
are extracted into separate folders within the project.

Based on the content, there are two types of xpm packages:

- packages with source libraries (**source** xpm packages)
- packages with executables, usually platform-specific binary
tools (**binary** xpm packages)

**Source xpm packages** are regular npm packages that include **library
source files**, typically in **C/C++**, though there are no language
restrictions.

**Binary xpm packages** are also regular npm packages, but with minimal
content, typically just the `package.json` file. Since these packages
provide executables for multiple platforms, some of which are quite
large, it is not practical to include all binaries within the npm
package itself. Instead, the `package.json` file contains references
(URLs) to platform-specific binary archives (e.g., `.tar.gz` for Unix or
`.zip` for Windows).

These archives are also expanded along with the package metadata.
Links/forwarders to
these executables are created in a `.bin` folder,
eliminating the need to add multiple folders to the `PATH`.

In summary, xpm packages can enhance and automate the installation
process for source libraries and tools.

In summary, xpm packages can streamline and automate the installation
process for source libraries and tools. Further details are available on the
