## Overview

{% if packageConfig.isOrganizationWeb == "true" -%}

**xPack Binary Development Tools** is a collection of standalone cross-platform binary tools, aimed at reproducible builds.

{% else -%}

{% assign names_array = "" | split: "" -%}

{% for platform in platforms_array -%}
{% if platform == "win32-x64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "Windows" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "darwin-x64" or platform == "darwin-arm64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "macOS" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "linux-x64" or platform == "linux-arm64" or platform == "linux-arm" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "GNU/Linux" %}{% endif -%}
{% endfor -%}

{% assign names_array = names_array | uniq -%}

**xPack {{packageConfig.longName}}** is a
standalone{% if names_array.size > 1 %}, cross-platform ({{ names_array | join: ", " }}){% else %} {{ names_array | first }}{% endif %} binary
distribution of {{packageConfig.longName}},
aimed at reproducible builds.

<details>
<summary>What are reproducible builds?</summary>

To be **reproducible**, an operation must remain stable over time and
across different environments. In other words, if builds are repeated
after some time, possibly on a different machine or platform, the
resulting behaviour must be functionally equivalent.

</details>

<Overview/>

{% if packageConfig.isOrganizationWeb != "true" -%}

The open source **xPack {{packageConfig.longName}}** project is hosted on GitHub as
[`{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}`](https://github.com/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}/);
it provides the platform specific binaries as
[release assets](https://github.com/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}/releases).

In addition to the binary archives and the package metadata,
this project also includes the
[build scripts](https://github.com/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}/tree/xpack/build-assets/scripts).

## What are xpm packages? (xPacks) {#xpm-packages}

**xpm packages**, abbreviated as **xPacks**, are versatile,
language-neutral software packages. They have been successfully
utilised in C/C++ projects.

<details>
<summary>What the heck are xpm packages (xPacks)? Please, do not introduce another package format!</summary>

Although the initial appearance may seem complex, utilising
xpm packages is, in fact, straightforward.
The design rationale is to automate frequent
operations that occur during software development, such as the
installation of
dependencies, and to ensure reproducibility.

These packages are managed by **[xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/)**
(the xPack Project Manager),
a programme that complements the **[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/)** CLI
(the popular JavaScript package manager), with new language-neutral features.

The xPacks Framework **does NOT introduce a new package format**; instead,
it uses **the same format as npm packages**, which is a collection of
files/folders and a `package.json` file with the package metadata.

**xpm** can install packages from the
same repositories as **npm**, whether public or private.

The packages (usually regular archives, but also git repositories),
are extracted into separate folders within the project.

Based on the content, there are two types of xpm packages:

- packages with source libraries (**source** xpm packages)
- packages with executables, usually platform-specific binary
tools (**binary** xpm packages)

**Source xpm packages** are regular npm packages that include **library
source files**, typically in **C/C++**, though there are no language
restrictions.

**Binary xpm packages** are also regular npm packages, but with minimal
content, typically just the `package.json` file. Since these packages
provide executables for multiple platforms, some of which are quite
large, it is not practical to include all binaries within the npm
package itself. Instead, the `package.json` file contains references
(URLs) to platform-specific binary archives (e.g., `.tar.gz` for Unix or
`.zip` for Windows).

These archives are also expanded along with the package metadata.
Links/forwarders to
these executables are created in a `.bin` folder,
eliminating the need to add multiple folders to the `PATH`.

In summary, xpm packages can enhance and automate the installation
process for source libraries and tools.

In summary, xpm packages can streamline and automate the installation
process for source libraries and tools. Further details are available on the
[xpm Concepts](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/docs/guide/concepts/) page.

## Features

All binaries are:

- **Self-contained** (include all required libraries).
- **File-system relocatable** (can be installed in any location).
- Built on slightly older systems (to ensure compatibility with both
old and new systems).

<details>
<summary>Compatibility with older systems</summary>

Given that most operating systems maintain significant compatibility
with older versions, building an application on an older system ensures
that the same binary can run on newer versions. Conversely, building an
application on a newer system may utilize library features that are
not available in older versions, making backward compatibility less
feasible.

</details>

Similarly to [flatpacks](https://flatpak.org) or [snap](https://snapcraft.io),
but significantly simpler, xpm packages include all dependent shared libraries
within the distributed archives, making the binaries independent of
any similar libraries installed on the system. This ensures they
can run on any system without needing specific libraries to be
installed.

Also the builds are configured so that the binaries do not depend on
being installed in specific folders, and can be installed in any
location, including in user folders.

## Benefits

The main advantages of using the **xPack {{packageConfig.longName}}** are:

{% assign names_array = "" | split: "" -%}

{% for platform in platforms_array -%}
{% if platform == "win32-x64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "x64 Windows" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "darwin-x64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "x64 macOS" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "darwin-arm64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "arm64 macOS" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "linux-x64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "x64 GNU/Linux" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "linux-arm64" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "arm64 GNU/Linux" %}{% endif -%}
{% if platform == "linux-arm" %}{% assign names_array = names_array | concat: "arm GNU/Linux" %}{% endif -%}
{% endfor -%}

- A convenient, uniform and portable install/uninstall/upgrade
{% if names_array.size > 1 %}procedure; the same procedure is used for all major
  platforms (**{{ names_array | join: "**, **" }}**){% else %}procedure on **{{ names_array | join: "" }}**{% endif %}.
- Multiple versions of the same package can be installed at the same time on
  the same system.
- No need to worry about dependent libraries, they are all included.
- Not affected by system updates that
  might change the versions of the dependent libraries.
- Significantly lighter and easier to use than Docker images that provide
  similar functionality and are GNU/Linux centric.
- Projects can be tied to specific tools versions; this provides a good
  reproducibility, especially useful in **CI/CD** environments.

## Install

The executables and other related files can be installed automatically with
**xpm** or manually by downloading the
**platform specific archives**.

on various platforms are presented in the
**Install Guide** of each project web site.
