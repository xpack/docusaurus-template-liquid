The project is written in modern C++ and, for reproducibility reasons,
uses the xPack Framework tools during development.

<CommonPrerequisites nodeVersion="18.0.0" nodeVersionMajor="18"/>

<CommonGetProjectSources />

<CommonGetHelperSources helperOrganizationName="micro-os-plus"  helperProjectName="build-helper-xpack" helperBranchName="xpack-development" />

## Satisfy dependencies

Go to the project folder:

```sh
cd ~/Work/xpack/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}.git
```

and run the following commands:

```sh
npm install
npm install -C tests
xpm install -C tests
```

## Language standard compliance

The library is written in modern C++ and should be compiled with `-std=c++20`.

## Tests

The ÂµOS++ testing strategy involves compiling the sources with
as many toolchains as possible and executing them on a wide
range of platforms.

### Host Platforms

The tests can be executed on any of the supported host
platforms:

- GNU/Linux (x64 and arm64, **GLIBC>=2.28**); to run the native
tests, a C++ development environment is required
(on Ubuntu install `build-essential`)
- macOS (>= **11.0**);
as C++ development environment use **Command Line Tools**
- Windows 7 with the Universal C Runtime (UCRT), Windows 8, Windows 10,
Windows 11

### Target Platforms

The supported target test platforms are:

- `platforms/native` - run the test applications as **native processes**
  on the development machine
- `platforms/qemu-cortex-m0` - run the tests as fully semihosted
  **Cortex-M0** applications on a QEMU **mps2-an385** emulated board
  (an Arm Cortex-M3 development board)
- `platforms/qemu-cortex-m3` - run the tests as fully semihosted
  **Cortex-M3** applications on a QEMU **mps2-an385** emulated board
  (an Arm Cortex-M3 development board)
- `platforms/qemu-cortex-m4f` - run the tests as fully semihosted
  **Cortex-M4** applications on a QEMU **mps2-an386** emulated board
  (an Arm Cortex-M4 development board)
- `platforms/qemu-cortex-m7f` - run the tests as fully semihosted
  **Cortex-M7** applications on a QEMU **mps2-an500** emulated board
  (an Arm Cortex-M7 development board)
- `platforms/qemu-cortex-a15` - run the tests as fully semihosted
  **Cortex-A15** applications on a QEMU **virt** emulated board
- `platforms/qemu-cortex-a72` - run the tests as fully semihosted
  **Cortex-A72** (64-bit) applications on a QEMU **virt** emulated board
- `platforms/qemu-riscv-rv32imac` - run the tests as fully semihosted
  **RISC-V RV32IMAC** applications on a QEMU **virt** emulated board
- `platforms/qemu-riscv-rv64imafdc` - run the tests as fully semihosted
  **RISC-V RV64IMAFDC** applications on a QEMU **virt** emulated board

The build configurations use exactly the same source files on all platforms,
without changes.

### Semihosting

On embedded platforms, the applications interact with the
host via the
[Arm semihosting mechanism](https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/main/semihosting/semihosting.rst).

### Toolchains

To enhance source code portability, the builds are repeatedly conducted
using various toolchains, including multiple versions of the same toolchain.

The following toolchains are used:

- gcc (native)
- clang (native)
- arm-none-eabi-gcc (Cortex-M, AArch32)
- aarch64-none-elf-gcc (AArch64)
- risc-none-elf-gcc (RISC-V 32/64)
