The strategy with the development builds is to run them in descending order
({versionMajor()}.2, {versionMajor() - 1}.3, {versionMajor() - 2}.4, {versionMajor() - 3}.5).

For this update the top `package.json` and `build-assets/scripts/VERSION` files
and run the build scripts.

After each build, save the folder hierarchies and executables, to be used
in the blog posts.

Then perform the steps to make the production builds in ascending order
({versionMajor() - 3}.5, {versionMajor() - 2}.4, {versionMajor() - 1}.3, {versionMajor()}.2),
with full tests and website updates.
