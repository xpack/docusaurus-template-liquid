## Prepare the website

The documentation site is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and
published in the project
[GitHub Pages]({{packageHomepage}}).

- switch to the `{{branchDevelopment}}` branch
- run the `website-generate-commons` script in the top `package.json`
- **commit** all changes
- run the `build` npm script in `website/package.json`
- fix any broken links, if any

## Publish the website

The website deployment is performed automatically when pushing to the
`{{branchWebsite}}` branch, by a dedicated workflow in
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}/actions/workflows/publish-github-pages.yml).

- switch to the `{{branchWebsite}}` branch
- **merge** the `{{branchDevelopment}}` branch into the `{{branchWebsite}}` branch
- **push** the `{{branchWebsite}}` branch to GitHub

At this moment an automated GitHub Action will generate and publish the website.

- the new release blog post is
in {{packageHomepage}}blog/
- remember the post URL, since it must be used to update the release page
and the X/Twitter announcement

The `{{branchWebsite}}` branch may be subsequently updated, as long as the
version in `package.json` is not changed.

Check the result at {{packageHomepage}}.
