### Prerequisites

The only requirement for an automated install is a recent
[xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/), which is a portable
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) command line application
that complements [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com)
with several extra features specific to
**C/C++ projects**.

To install **xpm**,
follow the instructions in the
[xpm install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page.

If already installed, it is always a good idea to update it to the
latest version with:

```sh
npm install --location=global xpm@latest
```

:::tip

Although not mandated by **xpm**, it is also a good idea to upgrade
**npm** to the latest version, and
**node** to a reasonably recent version (currently **npm** requires
a **node** >=18.17.0).

<details>
<summary>Local installs</summary>

One of the xPack design goals is to allow each project to
choose the exact versions of the {% if isXpackBinary == "true" %}tools{% else %}libraries{% endif %} it requires.

Similarly to **npm** being able to install specific versions of the
JavaScript tools into each project,
**xpm** was also designed to be able to install specific versions of the
required {% if isXpackBinary == "true" %}binary tools{% else %}libraries{% endif %} locally into each project.

Therefore, similarly to the way **npm** installs the JavaScript packages into
`node_modules`, **xpm** installs the {% if isXpackBinary == "true" %}binary tools{% else %}libraries{% endif %} into
`xpacks`. Here there will be separate folders with the installed
packages, for example
<code>xpacks/{{packageScopedName}}</code>.

{%- if isXpackBinary == "true" %}

Each such folder includes the `package.json` file with the
project metadata and a sub-folder `.content` with the extracted
binary archive. The executables are usually in `.content/bin`.

:::tip

On some platforms, names starting with `.` (dot) might be hidden for
normal browsing, and seeing them requires
separate options (like `ls -A`) or, in file browsers, to enable
settings like **Show Hidden Files**.

<details>
<summary>The `xpacks/.bin` folder</summary>

If multiple binary packages are installed, in order to allow
the executables to be accessed, one possible solution is to add
all `<package>/.content/bin` folders to the `PATH`.

To simplify things, **npm** employs a separate `<project>/node_modules/.bin` folder
where it places links/forwarders
pointing to the actual executable files.

Similarly, **xpm** adds links/forwarders into
a separate `<project>/xpacks/.bin` folder.

With this setup, the project needs to prepend only this `.bin` folder
to the `PATH`, and all the required tools are accessible
and preferred to possible system tools.

<details>
<summary>Global installs and the user's global xPacks store</summary>

Given that some binary tools (such as toolchains) can be very large
(hundreds of megabytes or more), it is impractical to keep multiple
copies of these tools, one for each project.

Instead, **xpm** installs the binary packages only once
into a user's global xPacks store (a platform-dependent folder
within the home folder), thereby conserving disk space when the same
tools are used across multiple projects.

In order to allow the projects to access the binary tools installed in the
user's global xPacks store, instead of unpacking the archives in `xpacks`,
**xpm** adds symbolic links pointing to the **user's global xPacks store**.

The outcome is functionally equivalent to installing the tools into
each project, but without the wasted disk space.

:::tip

It is possible to force a local install into a project
by passing `--copy` to `xpm install`.

:::

if necessary, it is also possible to install packages only globally, without
creating local links/forwarders (see below).

</details>

<details>
<summary>The user xPacks cache</summary>

To save download time, all archives are first stored in a
cache, and all subsequent downloads are replaced with the
cached content.

Therefore all published archives should be read-only and
it is not allowed to replace them at a later time.
