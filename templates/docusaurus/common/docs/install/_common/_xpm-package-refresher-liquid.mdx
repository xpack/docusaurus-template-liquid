<summary>xpm packages (xPacks) refresher</summary>

**xpm packages**, abbreviated as **xPacks**, are general-purpose,
language-neutral software packages.
They use **the same format as npm packages**,
which is a collection of files/folders
and a `package.json` file with the package metadata.

**xpm** can install source and binary packages.
{%- if isXpackBinary == "true" %}
Binary packages include references to regular archives with the platform
specific binaries (such as `.tar.gz` for Unix or `.zip` for Windows).
These archives are unpacked and links/forwarders to
the executables are created in a `.bin` folder.

For more details, please see the previous explanation in the
[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/#xpm-packages) page.
