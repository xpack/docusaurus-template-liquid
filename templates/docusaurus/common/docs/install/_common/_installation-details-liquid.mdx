<summary>Installation details</summary>

The above `xpm install` command will perform the following:

* identify the {% if isXpackBinary == "true" %}platform-specific archive for the {% endif %}desired version
  of {{packageScopedName}}, download it into a cache and unpack
  it into a versioned folder
  within the **user's global xPacks store** (if not already present);
  check the output of the `xpm install` command for the actual
  folder used on your platform;
* create a local symbolic link
  such as <code>xpacks/{{packageScopedName}}</code> pointing to the
  versioned folder in the user's global xPacks store
{%- if isXpackBinary == "true" %}
* add links/forwarders into
  the local `xpacks/.bin` folder, referring to the binaries in
  <code>xpacks/{{packageScopedName}}/.content/bin</code>;
{% endif %}
* add <code>{{packageScopedName}}</code> to
  `package.json` as a
  {% if isXpackBinary == "true" %}development {% endif %}dependency; this associates a specific version of {{preferredName}} with
  the current project (details below).

:::tip

The installation location may be configured using the
`XPACKS_STORE_FOLDER` environment variable; for more details please refer to the
