### CMake

To integrate the **{{packageName}}** library into a CMake application,
add the folder where this project is located to the build:

```cmake
add_subdirectory("xpacks/@micro-os-plus/{{packageName}}")
```

The result is **an interface library** that can be added as an application
dependency with:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your-target PRIVATE

  micro-os-plus::{{packageName}}
)
```
