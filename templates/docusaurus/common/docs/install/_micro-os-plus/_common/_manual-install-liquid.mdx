## Manual install

### Copy files

The traditional way of using source libraries is to simply copy them
into the user project.

The obvious advantage is simplicity, but the downside is that the
library becomes part of the project, and any improvements or bug fixes
must be manually copied to the project.

### Add as a Git submodule

Another common solution is to link the entire project as a **Git submodule**,
for example below an `xpacks` folder:

```sh
cd my-project
git init # Unless already a Git project
mkdir -p xpacks

git submodule add https://github.com/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}.git \
  xpacks/{{packageScopedName}}
```
