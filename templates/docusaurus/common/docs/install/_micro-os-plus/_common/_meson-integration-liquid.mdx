### Meson Build

To integrate the **{{packageName}}** library into a
[meson](https://mesonbuild.com) application,
add the folder where this project is located to the build:

```meson
subdir('xpacks/@micro-os-plus/{{packageName}}')
```

The result is **a dependency object** that can be added
to an application with:

```meson
exe = executable(
  your-target,
  link_with: [
    # Nothing, not static.
  ],
  dependencies: [
    micro_os_plus_{{packageName | replace: "-", "_"}}_dependency,
  ]
)
```
