## Quick tips

The **{{packageConfig.descriptiveName}}** comprises multiple individual
projects, each hosted on its own GitHub repository. Therefore, the most
effective way to receive prompt answers is to utilise the
GitHub Discussions
pages for the specific project you are interested in.

{%- else %}

## Quick links

The most efficient approach is to utilise the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}/discussions)
pages.

If you encounter any issues within the content of these pages (such as typographical errors or
incorrect phrasing) or have suggestions for improving the documentation,
please share them through the

GitHub Discussions pages. Utilise the top-level
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}/discussions)
page for issues relating to the main xPack Project site, or the individual project's GitHub Discussions pages for specific projects.
{%- else %}
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}/discussions)
pages.
{%- endif %}
Ensure you provide the full URL of the page, clearly identify the
section with the problematic content, and suggest improvements.

## Check documentation

As usual, before asking anything, it is advisable to review the project
documentation.
