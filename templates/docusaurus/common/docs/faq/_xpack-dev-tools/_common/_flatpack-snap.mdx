<summary>Flatpak & Snap also promise universal packages, why not utilise them?</summary>

The concise answer isâ€¦ _"because they work only on GNU/Linux"_.

Both [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org) and [Snap](https://snapcraft.io)
show promise as the future of application distribution. Whilst they may
eventually achieve this, they are currently specific to GNU/Linux, with
very limited prospect of expanding to other platforms.
