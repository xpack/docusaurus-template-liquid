## Deprecation notices

### GNU/Linux minimum requirements

The minimum requirement is **GLIBC 2.28**, available starting
with Ubuntu 20, Debian 10 and RedHat 8.
Support for RedHat 7 was dropped in 2022.
Support for Ubuntu 18 was dropped in 2025.

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit x64 GNU/Linux and x64 Windows was
dropped in 2022 and for 32-bit Arm GNU/Linux in 2025.

### Pre-deprecation notice for x64 macOS

Apple has discontinued support for the x64 (Intel) architecture.
GitHub will no longer support this architecture on macOS after the
macOS 15 runner image is retired in **November 2027**; building
and testing x64 macOS binaries will become more difficult, requiring
a self-hosted runner, and cannot be guaranteed in the long term.

You should begin migrating your projects to arm64-based (Apple Silicon)
binaries to prepare for this possible deprecation.
