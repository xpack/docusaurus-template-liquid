import {PageMetadata} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

The project configuration was upgraded to use **XBB v6.0.0** based
on **Debian 10** and **macOS 11**
and **support for Arm 32-bit was discontinued**.

Therefore, all future builds will use XBB v6.0.0 or later.

## GLIBC 2.28

The GNU/Linux base was raised to GLIBC 2.28, with builds performed on **Debian 10**.
The resulting binaries should run on Ubuntu 20 or later, RedHat 8 or later,
Fedora 29 or later, etc.

## MacOS 11.0

The macOS base was raised to 11.0, with builds performed on** macOS 11.7** with
`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET="11.0"`. The resulting binaries, both x64 and arm64,
should run on any macOS 11 or later.

## Support for Arm 32-bit discontinued

With regret for the inconvenience caused to some Raspberry Pi users,
due to the extremely high burdon on maintenance (toolchain builds took
more than half a day), support for Arm 32-bit GNU/Linux had to be discontinued.

This allowed all arm64 GNU/Linux builds to be performed on the Oracle Ampere
machine, which is many times faster than the Raspberry Pi 4 machines.

## Website updates

The website was also updated to reflect the new changes, and references to
**arm GNU/Linux**, **linux-arm** and **xbbla32**  were removed.
