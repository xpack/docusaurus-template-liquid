/**

@defgroup micro-os-plus µOS++ Topics
@brief Topics pertaining to the µOS++ Framework.
@details

The [µOS++](https://micro-os-plus.github.io) Framework constitutes the principal project, comprising multiple source libraries. These libraries are maintained as separate repositories on GitHub and are collectively managed under the [micro-os-plus](https://github.com/micro-os-plus) group.

@namespace micro_os_plus
@brief The primary namespace for the µOS++ framework.
@details
The micro_os_plus namespace provides a dedicated scope for all µOS++ classes, functions, variables, enumerations, type definitions, and related entities.

This namespace is further structured into additional nested namespaces. By encapsulating definitions within distinct namespaces, the framework achieves improved code organisation, reduced redundancy, and enhanced maintainability.

Such an approach fosters modular development and ensures seamless integration within µOS++, thereby contributing to a more efficient and scalable system.
