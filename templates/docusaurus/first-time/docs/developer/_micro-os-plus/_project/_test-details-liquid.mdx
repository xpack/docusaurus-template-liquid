### Tests details

#### sample-test

The [sample-test.cpp](https://github.com/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}/blob/xpack/tests/src/sample-test.cpp)
file is a straightforward application designed to demonstrate
how to utilise some of the primitives available in the library.

A typical run looks like:

```console
test 1
    Start 1: sample-test
...
1/2 Test #1: sample-test ......................   Passed    0.00 sec
```

#### unit-test

The [unit-test.cpp](https://github.com/{{githubProjectOrganization}}/{{githubProjectName}}/blob/xpack/tests/src/unit-test.cpp)
file is an exhaustive test designed to validate that all the
library functions operate as expected. It uses the
[ÂµTest++](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus-xpack)
testing framework.

A typical run looks like:

```console
test 2
    Start 2: unit-test
