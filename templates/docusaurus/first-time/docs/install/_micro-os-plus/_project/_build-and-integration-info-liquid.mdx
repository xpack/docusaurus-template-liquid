## Build & integration info

The project is written in C++, and it is expected to be used in C++ projects.

The source code has been compiled natively with **GCC** and **LLVM/clang**,
and cross-compiled on embedded **Arm** and **RISC-V** targets,
ensuring it is free from warnings.

To facilitate the integration of this library into user projects,
pre-made **CMake** and **meson** configuration files are provided
(see below).

For other build systems, please refer to the details provided below.

### Include folders

The following folders should be passed to the compiler during the build:

- `include`

The header files to be included in user projects are:

```cpp
#include <micro-os-plus/{{packageName}}.h>
```

### Source files

The source files to be added to user projects are:

- `src/xxx.cpp`

### Preprocessor definitions

There are several preprocessor definitions utilised to configure the build:

- `MICRO_OS_PLUS_INCLUDE_CONFIG_H` - to include `<micro-os-plus/config.h>`
- `MICRO_OS_PLUS_TRACE` - to include the trace calls
- `MICRO_OS_PLUS_TRACE_XXX` - to enable some tracing messages
